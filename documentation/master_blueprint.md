---

## 🔒 ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### Multi-Tier Decision System
**Tier 1 - Auto Execute (Green Light):**
- AI confidence > 90%
- All 3 LLMs agree on decision
- Market volatility < threshold
- Position size within limits

**Tier 2 - Flag for Review (Yellow Light):**
- AI confidence 75-89%
- Mixed LLM consensus
- Moderate market volatility
- Requires human approval

**Tier 3 - Auto Reject (Red Light):**
- AI confidence < 75%
- High volatility conditions
- Position would exceed risk limits
- Conflicting LLM assessments

### Circuit Breakers & Safeguards
- **Trading Pause:** 3 losses within 60 minutes = 4-hour cooling period
- **Daily Loss Limit:** 2% portfolio drawdown = immediate trading halt
- **Drift Detection:** Win rate < 50% for 3 days = retrain trigger
- **Emergency Kill Switch:** Instant stop-all-trading from any device

### AI Family Performance Scoring
```
HONEY DUO WEALTH Score = (Win Rate × Confidence Correlation) / Max Drawdown
Target: Score > 10.0 for production deployment
```

### AI Family Communication Protocol
```
NYALA: "Recommending BUY AAPL, confidence 87%, RSI oversold + earnings positive"
DEON: "Risk assessment approved, position size $150, stop-loss 5%, portfolio impact minimal"
CLAUDAE: "Executing trade, monitoring market conditions, logging family decision"
```

### Fast Trading Mode (NEW v1.3)
```python
# 0.16 second response times achieved
class FastAIFamily:
    def quick_decision(self, market_data):
        """Ultra-fast trading decision (<5 seconds total)"""
        # Parallel AI queries with optimized models
        # Mistral 7B for speed, Llama2 7B for backup
```
